# Veteran Nexus

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/scottpiercew/veteran_nexus.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/scottpiercew/veteran_nexus) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/scottpiercew/veteran_nexus/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/scottpiercew/veteran_nexus?branch=master)

This app was built following Test Driven Development using ```rspec, Capybara``` and Behavior Driven Development using a flushed out storyboard. I've written about the major steps I took to build my first TDD and BDD application. The setup was in major part thanks to Startup Rocket's tutorial.

## My First Passing Feature Spec!

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version 2.4.1, Rails 5.1.1

### Configuration

I used these gems to follow TDD and BDD for this app.

```
group :development, :test do
  gem 'rspec-rails'
  gem 'factory_girl_rails'
end

group :test do
  gem 'faker'
  gem 'capybara-webkit'
end
```

* ```rspec-rails``` is the testing framework for BDD.
* ```factory_girl_rails``` generates test data be establishing factories.
* ```faker``` generates fake data: names, addresses.
* ```capybara-webkit``` Webkit driver for Capybara. Capybara is an integration testing tool for web applications. It simulates how a user would interact with a website. I installed Qt for compiling capybara webkit.


* Deployed using Heroku
